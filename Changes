    No new features.

    Bugs fixed:

    - work around relative-`do` in Pod::Inherit by making sure
    that we load each file ourselves, this prepopulates in %INC
    and means that we should skip the file-loading step

0.007     2013-08-04 03:20:10 Europe/London
	No functional changes

	Dependency fixes:
	* Test::DZil is only installed on 4.200002+, but use 4.200010 to pick
	up some fixes which may be relevant

0.006     2013-08-03 03:21:38 Europe/London
	Bugs fixed:
	* Skip in-memory files without attempting to process them

0.005     2013-08-03 02:52:33 Europe/London
	Functional changes:
	* Previous attempt to generate in build only was a
	failure; we now use the FileGatherer role to inject
	the new .pod files.

	Test fixes:
	* Test that we're writing to build/, not source/
	* Also verify that source/ isn't touched

0.004     2013-08-03 02:14:29 Europe/London
	Functional changes:
	* Use the FileMunger and FileInjector roles so that
	we generate POD output in the build directory
	rather than affecting the original source paths

	Documentation:
	* Portability note and comment about .pod/.pm split
