=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PodInherit - use L<Pod::Inherit> to provide C<INHERITED METHODS> sections in POD

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Just add [PodInherit] to dist.ini. Currently there's no config options at all.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Simple wrapper around L<Pod::Inherit> to provide an 'inherited methods' section for
any modules in this distribution. See the documentation for L<Pod::Inherit> for more
details.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 gather_files

Called for each matching file (using :InstallModules so we expect
to find all the .pm files), we'll attempt to do pod generation for
the ones which end in .pm (case insensitive, will also match .PM).

=cut

sub gather_files {
    my ($self) = @_;
    foreach my $file (@{ $self->found_files }) {
        $self->process_pod($file) if $file->name =~ /\.pm$/i;
    }
    $self->log("Generated " . $self->generated . " POD files");
}

=head2 process_pod

Calls L<Pod::Inherit> to generate the merged C<.pod> documentation files.

=cut

sub process_pod {
    my ($self, $file) = @_;
    unless(-r $file->name) {
        $self->log_debug("Skipping " . $file->name . " because we can't read it, probably InMemory/FromCode");
        return;
    }

    $self->log_debug("Processing " . $file->name . " for inherited methods");
    local @INC = ('lib/', @INC);
    my $name = $file->name;
    my $cfg = Pod::Inherit->new({
        input_files => [$name],
        skip_underscored => 1,
        method_format => 'L<%m|%c/%m>',
        debug => 0,
    });
    Module::Load::load($cfg->_file_to_package($name));
    my $content = $cfg->create_pod($name) or return;

    # The encoding line does not make it through to the target file, so we
    # hardcode a value here. Ideally it'd match the original source... but
    # even more ideally, everything uses UTF-8 everywhere.
    $content = "=encoding utf8\n\n$content" unless $content =~ /^=encoding/;

    (my $output = $file->name) =~ s{\.pm$}{.pod}i;
    $self->add_file(
        my $new = Dist::Zilla::File::InMemory->new({
            name    => $output,
            content => $content,
        })
    );
    $self->log_debug("Generated POD for " . $file->name . " in " . $new->name);
    $self->generated($self->generated + 1);

=head1 BUGS

Some of the path and extension handling may be non-portable, should probably
use L<File::Basename> and L<File::Spec>.

Also, generating an entire .pod output file which is identical apart from the
extra inherited methods section seems suboptimal, other plugins such as
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PodVersion> manage to update the source .pm file
directly so perhaps that would be a better approach.
