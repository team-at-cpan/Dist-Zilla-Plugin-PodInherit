=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PodInherit - use L<Pod::Inherit> to provide C<INHERITED METHODS> sections in POD

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Just add [PodInherit] to dist.ini. Currently there's no config options at all.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Simple wrapper around L<Pod::Inherit> to provide an 'inherited methods' section for
any modules in this distribution. See the documentation for L<Pod::Inherit> for more
details.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 gather_files

Called for each matching file (using :InstallModules so we expect
to find all the .pm files), we'll attempt to do pod generation for
the ones which end in .pm (case insensitive, will also match .PM).

=head2 process_pod

Calls L<Pod::Inherit> to generate the merged C<.pod> documentation files.

=head1 BUGS

Some of the path and extension handling may be non-portable, should probably
use L<File::Basename> and L<File::Spec>.

Also, generating an entire .pod output file which is identical apart from the
extra inherited methods section seems suboptimal, other plugins such as
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PodVersion> manage to update the source .pm file
directly so perhaps that would be a better approach.
