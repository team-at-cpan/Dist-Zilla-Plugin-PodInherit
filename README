NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PodInherit - use Pod::Inherit to provide INHERITED
    METHODS sections in POD

SYNOPSIS

    Just add [PodInherit] to dist.ini. Currently there's no config options
    at all.

DESCRIPTION

    Simple wrapper around Pod::Inherit to provide an 'inherited methods'
    section for any modules in this distribution. See the documentation for
    Pod::Inherit for more details.

METHODS

 gather_files

    Called for each matching file (using :InstallModules so we expect to
    find all the .pm files), we'll attempt to do pod generation for the
    ones which end in .pm (case insensitive, will also match .PM).

 process_pod

    Calls Pod::Inherit to generate the merged .pod documentation files.

BUGS

    Some of the path and extension handling may be non-portable, should
    probably use File::Basename and File::Spec.

    Also, generating an entire .pod output file which is identical apart
    from the extra inherited methods section seems suboptimal, other
    plugins such as Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PodVersion manage to update the
    source .pm file directly so perhaps that would be a better approach.
